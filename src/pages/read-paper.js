 //foundationGMAI
 const paperAbstract1 = "The exceptionally rapid development of highly flexible, reusable artificial intelligence (AI) models is likely to usher in newfound capabilities in medicine. We propose a new paradigm for medical AI, which we refer to as generalist medical AI (GMAI). GMAI models will be capable of carrying out a diverse set of tasks using very little or no task-specific labelled data. Built through self-supervision on large, diverse datasets, GMAI will flexibly interpret different combinations of medical modalities, including data from imaging, electronic health records, laboratory results, genomics, graphs or medical text. Models will in turn produce expressive outputs such as free-text explanations, spoken recommendations or image annotations that demonstrate advanced medical reasoning abilities. Here we identify a set of high-impact potential applications for GMAI and lay out specific technical capabilities and training datasets necessary to enable them. We expect that GMAI-enabled applications will challenge current strategies for regulating and validating AI devices for medicine and will shift practices associated with the collection of large medical datasets.";
 //FHIRGenomics
 const paperAbstract2 = "The development of Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) Genomics, a feasible and efficient method for exchanging complex clinical genomic data and interpretations, is described. FHIR Genomics is a subset of the emerging Health Level 7 FHIR standard and targets data from increasingly available technologies such as next-generation sequencing. Much care and integration of feedback have been taken to ease implementation, facilitate wide-scale interoperability, and enable modern app development toward a complete precision medicine standard. A new use case, the integration of the Variant Interpretation for Cancer Consortium (VICC) ‚Äúmeta-knowledgebase‚Äù into a third-party application, is described.";
 //YamanakaFactors
 const paperAbstract3 = "Differentiated cells can be reprogrammed to an embryonic-like state by transfer of nuclear contents into oocytes or by fusion with embryonic stem (ES) cells. Little is known about factors that induce this reprogramming. Here, we demonstrate induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic or adult fibroblasts by introducing four factors, Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4, under ES cell culture conditions. Unexpectedly, Nanog was dispensable. These cells, which we designated iPS (induced pluripotent stem) cells, exhibit the morphology and growth properties of ES cells and express ES cell marker genes. Subcutaneous transplantation of iPS cells into nude mice resulted in tumors containing a variety of tissues from all three germ layers. Following injection into blastocysts, iPS cells contributed to mouse embryonic development. These data demonstrate that pluripotent stem cells can be directly generated from fibroblast cultures by the addition of only a few defined factors.";
